CONTRIBUTING
============

* Open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/blendlabs/angular-dataform/pull/new/master)
* Make sure your PR is on a **new branch** you created off of the latest version of master
* Do **not** open a PR from your master branch
* Open a PR to start a discussion even if the code isn't finished (easier to collect feedback this way)
* Do **NOT** commit your changes to the [dist files](https://github.com/blendlabs/angular-dataform/tree/master/dist)
* Make sure all previous tests pass and add new tests for added behaviors
